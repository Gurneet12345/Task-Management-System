AWS Task Manager Project Submission
1. Project Title
AWS Task Manager
2. Project Scope
The AWS Task Manager is a simple web application that allows users to submit tasks through a React frontend. These tasks are stored in an AWS DynamoDB table and simultaneously sent as notifications via AWS SNS. The backend is powered by Node.js (Express) and uses AWS SDK v3 to connect to AWS services.
3. Architecture Overview
Frontend (React) → Backend (Express + Node.js) → AWS DynamoDB & AWS SNS
User submits a task ➜ Backend stores it in DynamoDB ➜ A notification is sent using SNS.
4. AWS Services Used
- Amazon DynamoDB (task storage)
- Amazon SNS (notification delivery)
- IAM (user and permission management)
- CloudWatch (for future monitoring setup)
5. AWS Console Access
A read-only IAM user has been created for instructor review.
